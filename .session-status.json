  "summary": "Design improvements + agile process setup + testing milestone kickoff. Implemented modern UI overhaul (2×2 grid quick stats, water visual indicators, alcohol 2-column pills, gradient accents, compact health score). Setup complete agile workflow with Definition of Done and sprint review process. Performed accessibility audit (51% → ~70%). Fixed 3 critical accessibility issues: sage green gradient contrast (#17), water glasses screen reader (#18), alcohol pills aria-pressed (#19). All process documentation in place. Ready for test infrastructure setup.",
